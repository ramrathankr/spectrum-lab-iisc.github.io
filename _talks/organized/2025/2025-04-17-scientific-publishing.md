  **1) Publishing process; Ethics and Etiquette: "Things you should know before submitting your next paper"**
  
  The lecture is particularly addressed to new authors with little experience about the publication workflow and principles, and it is focused on the dos and don'ts for successfully publishing a technical paper. It offers an overview of the peer-review process and discusses the ethics and etiquette standards that authors are expected to uphold and that reviewers and editors are looking for. The lecture is based on material used at IEEE training events for authors and volunteers, supplemented by additional material by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE); it discusses general principles followed by various publishers and communities in science and engineering.
  
  Topics include: choice of the publication venue, framing of the contribution with respect to prior art and literature, authorship and acknowledgment, fair reporting of own and others' results, appropriate disclosure and referencing to own previous work, appropriate description and citing of prior work, plagiarism, duplicate submissions, inappropriate replication, and bibliometric manipulation, author's responsibilities.

  **2) Responding to reviews and managing the revision process**
  
  It is extremely rare (though not impossible) that a manuscript submitted to a top-tier journal gets accepted "as is" after the review of the original submission. Most often the manuscript goes through an iterative process, where editors interact with authors and reviewers with the goal of revising the manuscript to make it suitable for publication in the journal. The lecture discusses the manuscript revision process, highlighting the editorial perspective and the typical mistakes that authors make. Participants will learn how to manage and execute a productive and efficient revision, ultimately maximizing the chances that the revised manuscript will get accepted, and in fewer iterations.
