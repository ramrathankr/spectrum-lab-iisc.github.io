abstract: |
  In the first part of the talk, we will discuss the requirements of verifiable first-past-the-post electronic voting with cast-as-intended, recorded-as-cast, and counted-as-recorded guarantees. We will also discuss the requirements of graceful recovery in case elections fail to verify. As a case study, we will present a cryptographic voting protocol that partially meets the requirements.
  
  In the second part of the talk, we will discuss the issues of eligibility verification, and privacy preserving yet verifiable voters lists.
