biography_paragraphs:
  - "I have received my Bachelor of Engineering with Honours degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India in 2022. I'm currently pursuing Master of Technology degree in Signal Processing at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India. My academic interests focus on signal processing, time–frequency analysis, and machine learning. I contributed as a Teaching Assistant for the Time–Frequency Analysis course during the Aug–Dec 2025 term. I have also interned at Texas Instruments for eight weeks as an Application Engineer.  I am a recipient of the Texas Instruments Scholarship 2025-26. Beyond my core specialization, I am deeply interested in image processing, embedded systems, and circuit design, especially in understanding how these fields connect back to signal processing."
  - "What drives me is an insatiable curiosity. I enjoy exploring every dimension of learning—from casual conversations to highly technical discussions. I often reflect on the unexpected connections between topics and admire the creativity through which people interpret the world. Teaching, in particular, is something I love; it challenges me, inspires me, and remains one of the most fulfilling avenues for my personal growth."
