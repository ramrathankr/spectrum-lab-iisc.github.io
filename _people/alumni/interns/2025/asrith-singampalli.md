biography_paragraphs:
  - "I am a third-year undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) Surathkal. My interests lie in deep learning, with a focus on computer vision, and embedded systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of intelligent algorithms and hardware, and I am particularly interested in building efficient, real-world systems that bring learning-based models to embedded platforms."
