biography_paragraphs:
  - "My name is P. Shishir Aithal, and I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BMS Institute of Technology and Management, Bengaluru. I have a strong interest in advanced engineering systems that integrate electronics, control, and mechanical design."
  - "After completing my BE, I worked for four months at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) under the New Tech Aerospace contract, where I was involved in embedded systems and digital hardware design activities, gaining exposure to high-reliability aerospace engineering practices and structured technical documentation."
  - "During my academic and project work, I designed and developed an innovative morphing drone, capable of changing its arm configuration mid-air using servo-actuated mechanisms. The drone was built using carbon-fiber structures and integrated flight controllers, embedded controllers, and power electronics to achieve stable flight across multiple configurations. This project received recognition at technical competitions and reflects my interest in aerospace and unmanned systems."
  - "Currently, I am undergoing four months of specialized training for the Electro-Technical Officer (ETO) role in the Merchant Navy, where I am gaining practical exposure to marine electrical systems, generators, automation, alarm and monitoring systems, and shipboard electrical safety practices."
  - "I am motivated to build a professional career in the Merchant Navy as an Electro-Technical Officer, applying my engineering background to support safe and efficient ship operations."
