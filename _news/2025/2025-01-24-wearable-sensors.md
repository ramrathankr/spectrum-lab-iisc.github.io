abstract: |
  Advances in nano-fabrication and MEMS devices have led to radical improvements in sensing technologies in recent years. These improvements are most visible to all of us in our SmartPhones that already feature a panoply of miniaturized sensors. Many of the same sensors are also positively impacting several other application domains. In this talk, we highlight how smart light-weight body worn sensors are set to revolutionize healthcare and the practice of medicine by providing technologies for assessing biomarkers for physiological and physical attributes related to disease condition, treatment effectiveness, and longitudinal progression. In contrast with the subjective, sporadic in-clinic assessments that are in common use today, body-worn sensors can provide objective and repeatable measurements and based on extended periods of continuous monitoring. We present examples from our recent and ongoing research that features light-weight, low-power sensors that can be affixed to the body like adhesive temporary tattoos, in a diverse set of health monitoring applications including quantification of movement disorders for Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, stroke rehabilitation, and cardiac monitoring. We present examples of signal processing and data analytics for these applications that effectively exploit the sensor measurements. Finally, we highlight ongoing and emerging directions for research and development.

From 1993 through 2003, he was with the Xerox Innovation group in Webster, NY, most recently in the position of Principal Scientist and Project Leader. His research interests include data analytics, cyber physical systems, signal and image processing, computer vision, and media security; areas in which he has 56 patents and has authored over 220 journal and conference publications. He served as the Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing from 2018 through 2020, and for the Journal of Electronic Imaging from 2011 through 2015. He is a member of the IEEE Publications, Products, and Services Board (PSPB) and chaired the IEEE Conference Publications Committee in 2017-18. He is the editor of the Digital Color Imaging Handbook published by CRC press in 2003. Dr. Sharma is a fellow of the IEEE, a fellow of SPIE, a fellow of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&T) and has been elected to Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, and Pi Mu Epsilon. In recognition of his research contributions, he received an IEEE Region I technical innovation award in 2008 and the IS&T Bowman award in 2021. Dr. Sharma served as a 2020-2021 Distinguished Lecturer for the IEEE Signal Processing Society.
